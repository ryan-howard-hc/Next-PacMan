MoSCoW for Simple Pac-Man Game in Next.js:

Must-Have:
1. Create a game board/grid.
2. Implement Pac-Man movement (up, down, left, right).
3. Place Pac-Man and ghosts on the board.
4. Define collision detection between Pac-Man and ghosts.
5. Implement score tracking.
6. Implement game over conditions (e.g., Pac-Man collides with a ghost).

Should-Have:
1. Add pellets or coins for Pac-Man to collect.
2. Implement power-ups for Pac-Man.
3. Add sound effects and background music.
4. Create a game start screen and game over screen.

Could-Have:
1. Implement different levels with increased difficulty.
2. Add animations for Pac-Man, ghosts, and other game elements.
3. Implement a timer or time-based gameplay elements.

Won't-Have:
1. Multiplayer functionality.
2. Complex AI behavior for ghosts.
3. Advanced graphics and visual effects beyond the basic gameplay.

Pseudocode Structure:
- Initialize game board/grid.
- Initialize Pac-Man and ghosts positions.
- while game_not_over:
    - Handle user input for Pac-Man movement.
    - Update Pac-Man position based on input.
    - Check collision between Pac-Man and ghosts.
    - Update score based on collected pellets/coins.
    - Check game over conditions.
    - Render updated game state on the screen.
- Display game over screen and final score.



## Sample Code

// Define constants
const BOARD_WIDTH = 10;
const BOARD_HEIGHT = 10;
const PACMAN = 'P';
const GHOST = 'G';
const EMPTY = '.';
const COIN = 'C';
const POWER_UP = 'U';

// Initialize game state
let gameBoard = createEmptyBoard(BOARD_WIDTH, BOARD_HEIGHT);
let pacmanPosition = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let ghostPositions = [{ x: 8, y: 8 }, { x: 5, y: 5 }]; ?????
let score = 0;
let gameOver = false;

// Function to create an empty game board
function createEmptyBoard(width, height) {
    let board = [];
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
        let row = [];
        for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
            row.push(EMPTY);
        }
        board.push(row);
    }
    return board;
}

// Function to render the game board
function renderBoard() {
    // Code to render the game board on the screen
    // Use HTML elements or canvas to display the game board
}

// Function to handle Pac-Man movement
function movePacman(direction) {
    // Code to move Pac-Man based on direction
    // Update pacmanPosition based on user input (up, down, left, right)
}

// Function to update game state
function updateGameState() {
    // Code to handle collision detection between Pac-Man and ghosts
    // Check if Pac-Man's new position collides with any ghost's position
    // Update game board with new positions after movement

    // Code to handle coin collection and power-ups
    // Check if Pac-Man's new position contains a coin or a power-up
    // Update score accordingly
    // Remove the collected coin or power-up from the game board

    // Check for win or lose conditions
    // If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, set gameOver to true
    // If all coins or certain objectives are collected, set gameOver to true
}

// Game loop
while (!gameOver) {
    renderBoard(); // Render the game board
    let userInput = getNextUserInput(); // Get user input (from keyboard or other input methods)
    movePacman(userInput); // Move Pac-Man based on user input
    updateGameState(); // Update game state after Pac-Man moves
}

// Display game over screen and final score
displayGameOverScreen(score);
